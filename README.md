# Paupa---React
A full-stack React application (featuring MondoDB, Express, Node.js, Fixer API and Chart JS) serving as a to-do list/expense tracker for people who are grieving and need guidance. My mom really needed help when it came to life after my dad and she had nowhere to go. Therefore, I want the app to guide people through what normal funeral processes costs and help create a timeline for them to get things done so that they can focus on healing themselves and their family. 

## Style Inspiration

Paupa was created in honor of my father who died of stage 4 brain cancer. I wanted the look and feel of the app to focus on the freedom that comes from passing on, instead of the lonliness. I wanted my login to mean something to both me and anyone who lost someone. The child blowing bubbles symbolizes me trying to get the message to my dad that I am okay. And if you look closely, you can see he's blowing bubbles back, meaning he got the message. 

## Accessiblity
One important thing I wanted to focus on was giving users an option to control what they saw and how they saw it. For example, they can choose to have their tasks and expenses combined or separated into their own lists

The form to create a "Paup" changes depending on whether or not you want to upload a task or an expense. If your creation passes validations, then it will be added to the appropriate list.

## Wide Audience

The app isn't just for those grieving but also freelancers. I implemented a chart that would update its data live whenever an expense is added and a currency converter for freelancers who deal with multiple forms of currency and want a one stop shop to keep track of everything.

## Future Plans
- Now that the functionality is almost complete, I want to dive into the real meaning of the app and help heal those who are grieving by adding a blog, chatroom, support videos, and text notifications.

Eugene Richard Woodside was someone who grew up poor and in the roughest neighborhoods of Florida. He was someone who was willing to do anything to make sure his kids didn't have the childhood he did. He raised us to love everyone and volunteered his time to mentor elementary school kids who weren't as lucky as we were to have a dad like him. He loved me no matter who I was and made sure I never felt alone. And I'll be sure to do the same with my children, Dad.
